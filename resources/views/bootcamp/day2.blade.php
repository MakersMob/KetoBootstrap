				<!--<p>Today we are going to explore what exactly the Ketogenic Diet is and why it works so well.</p>
				<p>The Keto Diet is a low-carb, moderate protein, and high-fat diet.</p>
				<p>It has been used for decades by people in the medical profession and has just recently began to hit the mainstream nutrition world.</p>
				<p>Now, low-carb diets are nothing new in the world of nutrition so what makes this one different?</p>
				<p>The idea behind the Keto Diet is to get your body into a metabolic state known as ketosis.</p>
				<h2>What Is Ketosis?</h2>
				<p>Odds are your body uses glucogen (sugar) for energy. That makes your body a sugar-burner.</p>
				<p>What happens when your body runs out of glucogen? It need another fuel source so it starts to produce ketones.</p>
				<p>Ketones help the liver process fat and the ketones carry the energy to the rest of the body.</p>
				<p>Your body is now a fat-burner.</p>
				<p>Sounds awesome, right?</p>
				<p>It is!</p>
				<p>The only problem is that you can knock your body out of ketosis if you have too many carbs.</p>
				<p>That's why it's important to understand your macro requirements and plan out your meals.</p>
				<h3>How Long to Get Into Ketosis?</h3>
				<p>This really depends on your body and what it has to work with.</p>
				<p>In general, the fastest way to get into ketosis is to consume less 20g of carbs daily.</p>
				<p>For some people, this will get them into ketosis in just a couple of days.</p>
				<h3>Testing for Ketosis</h3>
				<p>Of course, you can't know if you're in ketosis if you don't test for it. There are a couple of different methods to test if you are in ketosis.</p>
				<p>We use <a href="http://amzn.to/2jmFYRW" target="_blank">test strips</a> because they are cheap and easy to use.</p>-->
				<p>During the remainder of boot camp you will focus on the following steps:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Reduce sugar and high-carb foods</li>
					<li>Limit consumption of protein and focus on fatty rather than lean protein</li>
					<li>Eat plenty of HEALTHY fats</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Step 1: Reduce sugar and high-carb foods</h3>
				<p>By now you understand that sugar and complex carbs are just glucose-sugar. So step 1 of keto boot camp is to reduce your sugar and carb intake.</p>
				<p>Here are a couple of tips on how to reduce your sugar intake:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Read food labels-You'll quickly realize just how often sugar is added to foods when you look for it on ingredients lists. Even things that you don't think are sweet, like tomato sauce, crackers, condiments, and salad dressings can be packed with sugar.</li>
					<li>Learn other aliases for sugar. When you read food labels, you'll need to look for more than just the word sugar. Sugar hides under several sneaky names, including:
						<ul>
							<li>high fructose corn syrup</li>
							<li>sucrose</li>
							<li>agave nectar</li>
							<li>aspartame</li>
							<li>saccharin</li>
							<li>dried cane sugar</li>
							<li>invert sugar</li>
							<li>molasses</li>
							<li>brown rice syrup</li>
							<li>honey</li>
							<li>maple syrup</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>However, here are a few safe sugar-free sweeteners that are keto friendly-Stevia, Erythritol, Xylitol, and Swerve. Buy unsweetened. Once you know where sugar hides, you can start making changes. One strategy: buy foods labeled no added sugar or unsweetened.</li>
					<li>Stick with it! At first, cutting down on sugar can feel like an impossible task. Eventually, though, your taste buds will adjust.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Here are a couple of tips to reduce your carb intake:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Replacing carbs:
						<ul>
							<li>Exchange your breakfast carbs for protein alternatives. Instead of grabbing a breakfast pastry or smoothie, trying grabbing a hard boiled egg and some high-fat cheese instead.</li>
							<li>Swap your favorite bag of chips in for a handful of high protein nuts or seeds.</li>
							<li>Choose lettuce instead of bread or a bun for your sandwich.</li>
							<li>Double up on vegetables at dinner instead of pasta rice or potatoes. Cauliflower can be made riced or mashed and is an awesome substitute for starchy carbs.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Cut out hidden carbs:
						<ul>
							<li>Avoid sports drinks that are high in carbs and choose tea or coffee that offers the same energy boost without all the sugar.</li>
							<li>Limit juice drinks that have no fiber and are high in carbs.</li>
							<li>Beware of sauces and dips for your salads, vegetables, and meats. They are often loaded with extra carbs.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Reduce unhealthy carbs:
						<ul>
							<li>Avoid processed sugars and flours in exchange for their healthier options.</li>
							<li>Sodas are an empty calorie drink that offers no nutrition, but unhealthy carbs. Bump up your water intake instead.</li>
							<li>Reduce fast food fried carbs (fries, onion rings, pies) by choosing a healthier alternative like a side salad.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Step 2: Limit consumption of protein and focus on fatty rather than lean protein</h3>
				<p>I can't stress enough how important it is to not eat lean protein! Instead of chicken breasts choose chicken thigh, pork belly instead of pork chops. See our bodies are not equipped to handle lean protein. When we consume only lean protein it can cause an excess intake of nitrogen, which can create a buildup of ammonia in the bloodstream that is toxic to the brain.</p>
				<h3>Step 3: Eat plenty of HEALTHY fats</h3>
				<p>In order to become keto-adapted, you have to eat your healthy fats! When you are keto-adapted, healthy fat and lots of it is your fuel source. Fat is also what keeps you feeling full and satisfied and keeps cravings at bay. When it comes to which fats and oils to consume, the higher the amount of saturated fat it contains, the better. Saturated fats like MCT oil, coconut oil, and lard are your best choices. Grass-fed and organic sources are also a great option if you can get them.</p>
				<p>Avoid polyunsaturated fats which are found in products like margarine, vegetable oil, and vegetable shortening. These fats are unstable and you should steer clear of them at all times! Trans fats also should be avoided as they can be detrimental to your health.</p>
				<p>As you can see not all fats are equal!</p>
