				<p>Life would be easier if all of our bodies reacted the exact same way but they don't.</p>
				<p>This is important to remember.</p>
				<p>Why?</p>
				<p>Because if you see someone lose 10 lbs in the first week of being on Keto and you only lose 2 lbs that doesn't mean you did worse.</p>
				<p>Even if you followed the exact same regimen as the other person.</p>
				<p>Our bodies work the same but because our chemisty is slightly different that means we end up seeing slightly different results.</p>
				<!--
				<h2>Macros</h2>
				<p>Macros are something that you are going to become very familiar with. We actually have a whole <a href="https://ketodash.com/article/macros">section on Macros in our Keto Guide</a> so make sure you take the time to read it and also understand how to calculate your own.</p>
				<p>If you're having trouble calculating your macros just shoot me an email (elisa@ketodash.com) and I can help you with your first calculations.</p>-->
				<p>During my journey there was a time frame where the scale wasn't moving and I felt frustrated. I believed I was doing everything right so I couldnâ€™t understand why the scale wasn't moving. Luckily for me I was taking weekly measurement and when I took my measurements for that week I was surprised to find out I lost inches in my stomach and thighs!</p>
				<p>At the end of each week not only should you weigh in but you should also take measurements of your body.</p>
				<p><strong>Weighing in:</strong> Weigh yourself at the end of each week at the same time of day.</p>
				<p><strong>Measurements:</strong> When it comes to measurements I suggest taking the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>arms</li>
					<li>chest</li>
					<li>waist</li>
					<li>thighs</li>
					<li>calves</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You can also take these measurments when you do you weigh in.</p>
				<h3>Weight Loss Isn't the Only Goal</h3>
				<p>It's very easy to only get caught up in the weight loss aspect of keto.</p>
				<p>However, I've always found that it was the changes that I didn't see that were the most awesome.</p>
				<p>For example, as a woman I can experience mood swings. These are no fun for me or my husband.</p>
				<p>Keto has helped to regulate my hormones causing me to have less mood swings. In fact, I find myself randomly smiling for no apparent reason.</p>
				<p>In general, I feel like a happier person.</p>
