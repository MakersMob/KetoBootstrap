				<h3>What is Meal Prepping</h3>
				<p>Meal Prepping is simply preparing some, or all of your meals ahead of time. It’s like having those TV dinners that you would purchase from the store, except that you prepare them yourself, with better, healthier and unprocessed ingredients.</p>
				<h3>Why meal prep is important</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Save Money-This is probably the biggest reason to take the plunge into meal prepping. It will save you so much money! You'll be buying less excess food, eating everything that you buy, and you'll be buying in bulk.  Now that's a 3 pronged approach to keeping your pockets full if I've ever seen one.</li>
					<li>Portion Control is Automated-You will start portioning everything out on the weekend, so you don't have to play the guessing game of how much you should be eating during the week. When you measure out your food in advance you're going to be much more precise than when you measure it out at 9pm on an empty stomach. Let's face it, at 9pm you're throwing a couple extra slices of bacon onto your meal.</li>
					<li>Save Time-If your biggest obstacle is the amount of time it takes to cook healthy food on a daily basis then you're in the right place. Meal prepping usually takes about 1-3 hours and you've got everything you'll need for the week. That can break down to as little as 2.4 cooking time minutes per meal!</li>
					<li>Less Decisions-The less decisions the better. Try choosing a show to watch on Netflix...it's nearly impossible. Put your dietary decision making on autopilot. If you don't have to make a decision then it's awfully hard to decide to eat a donut.</li>
					<li>More Energy Spent Elsewhere- This is the benefit that I love most about meal prepping.  You have so much more mental space available since food isn't consuming such a large portion of it. Personally, my productivity skyrockets when "what am I going to eat for the day" doesn't pop into my brain 6-7 times a day.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Making meal prep easier</h3>
				<p>It’s important to remember to not get overwhelmed when you are a beginner. Too often people get bogged down in details when sticking to the basics will do more good.</p>
				<p>Don’t try to incorporate too many new things at once. Keep it SIMPLE!</p>
				<h4>1. Pick a day</h4>
				<p>The first thing you should do is pick a day to prepare all your meals. For most, Sunday is the best day because it’s a day when you are off work, kids are home from school, and you can enlist the help of the entire family if you need it.</p>
				<p>In the beginning though, you don’t want to prepare meals for the whole week. You want to start off with no more than three meals. We like to split my meal prepping days up. For us Sunday and Wednesday works best with our schedule. You can pick whatever works best with your schedule.</p>
				<p>When we meal prep I like to use My Macros+ to enter my meals so we can visually see where we stand with my macros for each and every day.</p>
				<h4>2. Pick the meals</h4>
				<p>You need to decide which meal you are going to prepare first: Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner.</p>
				<p>If you are preparing for a family, then prepping your dinner meals seems to be where you would get the most from your efforts. However, if you are single, then you may want to try to prepare breakfast or lunch meals first. Ultimately, the choice is yours. You just want to think about it a little before you get started. We personally find it easier to plan my dinners first followed by breakfast then lunch/snacks.</p>
				<p>After that, you want to decide on the recipes you are going to prepare.</p>
				<p>Looking through the <a href="https://ketodash.com/recipe?type=Meal">Meal Category</a> in the recipes section you'll see that many of the meals make 4-6 servings. This means that you can eat the same meal more than once. To get an idea of what I am talking about check out our <a href="https://ketodash.com/meal">Sample Meal Plans</a> to see how you can combine a couple of the same meals and diversify them throughout the week to make for a varied menu.</p>
				<p>For those with Kids you might not want to cook the same recipe for all three meals as you might have a bit of a fight on your hands. To keep things simple with kids we suggest making easy switches for them like using a different sauce, switching up veggies, or using the protein in a different way.</p>
				<p>For example: One night for dinner you might make Mexican Shredded Chicken with Cauliflower rice. Well the following night you could use the same Mexican Shredded Chicken and make a salad or even a pizza. These little swaps will help keep your kids interested in dinner and help keep you on point with your macros.</p>
				<p>Since we are trying to maintain specific macronutrient goals (proteins, fats, carbs) each day, we must take this into account when meal prepping.</p>
				<p><em>The rule of thumb is that for fats and proteins you usually want to be within 5 grams of hitting your daily macros. When it comes to your carbs you want to stay below 20g when starting off.</em></p>
				<p>When planning your meals like the Mexican Shredded Chicken you might be able to have 3oz of chicken with your cauliflower rice but the next night when you plan out your Mexican Shredded Chicken pizza you might  see you can only fit 2oz of chicken into your day. This happens during meal prep and it's ok just make sure you use a kitchen scale to help you with things like this.</p>
				<p>Check out the <a href="http://amzn.to/2eYdmOM">Food Scale</a> we like to use.</p>
				<p>When it comes to picking a food scales use one, simple as that! This will be the easiest way for you to record your food measurements when adding them into My Macros+ or MyFitnessPal. You can find these online at <a href="http://amzn.to/2eYdmOM">Amazon</a>, or at any Target store!</p>
				<p>Weighing your food:<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Weigh meat after it has been cooked</li>
					<li>Weigh your veggies after they have been cooked</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Meal frequency and size is up to you. If you’re not a breakfast person, that’s okay! If you would rather have three bigger meals instead of 6 smaller meals, go for it!</p>
				<h4>3. Use proper containers</h4>
				<p>When it comes to meal prepping you don't need fancy containers. I really can’t stress this enough. However, storing your food properly is really the foundation of your meal prepping.</p>
				<p>How you choose to store your meals can make or break your meal prepping efforts.</p> 
				<p>You don’t want to simply throw everything into Tupperware bowls. That defeats the whole point of preparing things.</p>
				<p>Throw it all in one big box and what you’ll have is a pile of goop — mmmm, tasty.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>What makes a good container?</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>For starters, that depends on you.</p>
				<p>If you want to be able to divide each part of your meal in one container for less clutter when packing your lunch then checkout these great <a href="http://amzn.to/2wj6nmd">Meal Prep Containers</a>.</p>
				<p>Or if you don't care about having one meal in multiple containers feel free to use any kind of tupperware you'd like.</p>
				<p>What we like to do is prepare 2-3 meals, break each item up into tupperware containers and then mix and match between lunch and dinner. We also like to use containers are clear, and that they are the same size. Clear containers allow you to quickly see what’s inside. Once you start preparing more and more meals, this simple feature will become invaluable.</p>
				<p>Put simply, you want containers that are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>BPA Free</li>
					<li>Freezer safe</li>
					<li>Dishwasher safe</li>
					<li>Microwavable</li>
					<li>Stackable</li>
					<li>Reusable</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>In the kitchen</h3>
				<p>Start off, like I said, with just a few meals. Don’t try to cook a whole week’s worth of meals in one sitting. You may want to do this later, as you get more comfortable, but for now, just try to find your meal-prepping-groove.</p>
				<p>Focus on simple meals. Chicken is a favorite among many meal preppers because it can be cooked in a seemingly endless number of ways. It’s also easy to store and freeze. With just a bit of chicken and a few vegetables you can easily prepare three totally different meals.</p>
				<p>Learn to Multitask: Remember that you can cook lots of different things at the same. Use your oven space to its fullest potential. There’s no need to place one thing in there at a time. Use multiple oven trays if it helps, or use aluminum foil to make dividers on one oven tray and multiply your efforts. Start with recipes that lend themselves to this type of cooking.</p>
				<p>When planning your first shopping trip as a meal prepper, ask yourself if you have enough oven trays, aluminum foil and other utensils you might need.</p>
				<p>The Crockpot: Okay, this one is obvious, yet so many new meal preppers overlook it. Use it to make simple, great tasting meals then store them away.</p>
				<p>Obviously I’m not trying to tell you how to cook your meals but hopefully this guide can make your life a little easier. After all, that’s what meal prepping is all about.</p>
				<!--<p>Congrats on making it through the Bootcamp!</p>
				<p>As you can see it wasn't that bad. The goal was to get you prepared for your switch to the Keto Lifestyle.</p>
				<p>On this final day let's talk about the mental aspect of it all.</p>
				<p>Any time you set a goal for yourself it is easy to get excited. The first couple of days go pretty smooth and then sometimes you hit a wall.</p>
				<p>You end up thinking that just one meal with some carbs isn't going to do any harm and on the outside it probably seems like it doesn't.</p>
				<p>What this does is give you an example that you can always fall back on with regards to future times you want to go back to carbs.</p>
				<p>You ate carbs once and nothing bad happened so you can do it again.</p>
				<p>After you spend some time in Ketosis and your body has adjusted appropriately this is absolutely true, but not at the beginning.</p>
				<p>This is why we made a big deal yesterday about meal prep because there are going to be obstacles in your way and the more prepared you are, the better you'll be able to handle them.</p>
				<p>What about the times your friends and family ask you to go out or have a pizza party?</p>
				<p>What are you going to do?</p>
				<p>This is going to be a pretty difficult journey at the beginning because so much of our lives are dicated by how we've been eating for most of our lives.</p>
				<p>When someone asks you to change then that's a pretty big deal and it can be mentally draining.</p>
				<p>You can no longer reach for the box of cereal when you're running late or just cook up some rice to act as filler.</p>
				<p>You might have expectations about weight loss and when you don't see immediate results this can lead to frustration and anger.</p>
				<p>You will feel that you've limited yourself to what you can do in life (even though you haven't) and think about when life was easier and you could just eat whatever you wanted.</p>
				<p>The best thing you can do is understand Why you are doing this.</p>
				<p>This really goes beyond just losing weight. We love Keto because of how it makes us feel about ourselves. Sure we love the bodies that it has shaped but mentally we love being in a happy place.</p>
				<p>It makes life much more enjoyable.</p>
				<p>We love having more energy. We love being able to think more clearly.</p>
				<p>These are often things we would forget about when we just wanted to reach for the bagel.</p>
				<p>Life is better for us because we are happier and that's what we want for you.</p>
				<p>Happiness.</p>
				<p>So be sure you are prepared for this journey and know that we are with you every step of the way.</p>-->
